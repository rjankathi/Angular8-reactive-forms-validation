# RxValidationErrors

A simple Angular library that exposes a ValidationErrorsService which simplifies the Reactive Forms validations.

Move validation messages to the component class which helps.
1. Easily unit test validation logic.
2. No hard coding of validation messages in the application
3. Change validation dynamically at run time.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project log-validation-errors-lib` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project log-validation-errors-lib`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project log-validation-errors-lib` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build log-validation-errors-lib` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build log-validation-errors-lib`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/log-validation-errors-lib` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test log-validation-errors-lib` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
